# Handwriting generation

An implementation of Alex Graves paper on handwriting generation https://arxiv.org/pdf/1308.0850.pdf.

A first version was written using tensorflow in the handwriting_gen.py file followed by a keras version.

Both codes are structures as follow: - part 1 : preparing the data to feed the neural network
                                     - part 2 : defining the model structure and training it with the prepared data
                                     - part 3 : using the trained parameters to generate handwriting strokes.
